What the nix is a simple guide created as a personal wiki to try to use nixos as a desktop daily driver.
The objective of this guide is to try to grasp all of the most important concepts for someone who wants to use the famous "1 config for everything" but still want's a somewhat "classic" desktop experience on linux.

This guide is oriented to someone who has prior at least basic experience in programming and linux, I will only cover the minimum necessary for the nixos concept to work

Feel free to explore and contribute!
