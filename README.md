# What The Nix?!?
What the nix is a simple guide created as a personal wiki to try to use nixos as a desktop daily driver.
The objective of this guide is to try to grasp all of the most important concepts for someone who wants to use the famous "1 config for everything" but still wants a somewhat "classic" desktop experience on linux.

This guide is oriented to someone who has prior at least basic experience in programming and linux, I will only cover the minimum necessary for the nixos concept to work.

You can get straight into the read from here: [[Getting Started/index]]

Because of the nature of nixos, I will try to add all of the sources from where I got the data for the specific topic at the end.

Feel free to explore and contribute!
## How can I Contribute?
Fork this repo, write some content and make a pull request.
## How do I edit the contents?
Open the repo as an obsidian vault.
## Why do you have an absurd amount of commits?
I use obsidian with the git plugin, so I can still write even if I'm not on my main computer and avoid losing data in the process.
