Welcome to NixOS! I'm so happy that you decided to give it a try!

# Download the ISO

Now with the important part. go to the [NixOS download website](https://nixos.org/download/#nixos-iso) and select your favourite Desktop Environment.

I used plasma in my computer but you can use the one that best suits to your needs, the DE doesn't really impact on the installation process, as later on we can decide the one that we want to install.

Keep in mind that if you're in a desktop PC you should use the `64-bit Intel/AMD` ISO's, `64-bit ARM` ISO's are for devices like the Raspberry Pi.

# Verify that the ISO hash matches the ones provided in the website
