title: What The Nix?!?
---
What the nix is a simple guide created as a personal wiki to try to use nixos as a desktop daily driver.
The objective of this guide is to try to grasp all of the most important concepts for someone who wants to use the famous "1 config for everything" but still wants a somewhat "classic" desktop experience on linux.

This guide is oriented to someone who has prior at least basic experience in programming and linux, I will only cover the minimum necessary for the nixos concept to work.

You can get straight into the read from here: [[Getting Started/index|Getting Started With NixOS]]
The rest of the structure is (hover for more details):
- [[Getting Started/index|Getting Started]]: The basics to start using NixOS
- [[Concepts]]: Important concepts where the entire wiki takes reference.
- [[Fixes/index|Fixes]]: Folder full of configurations to fix something in particular, patches or scripts.
- [[Problems/index|Problems]]: Collection of problems that could be treated with [[Fixes/index|Fixes]]
- [[Investigations]]: The place where I save random data that I've found scattered all around the web 

Because of the nature of nixos, I will try to add all of the sources from where I got the data for the specific topic at the end.
