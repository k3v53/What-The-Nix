Welcome to this part of nix, if you read everything from here and you reached this point I only have to say that I'm actually impressed that you managed to understand everything and want more, from now on we're going to cover weird, abstract, difficult or very undocumented parts of the nix ecosystem.

- [[nix-shell]]
- [[builtins]]
- [[lib]]
I love this iceberg because I still don't understand it and probably take some good months to actually laugh while reading the entries.
